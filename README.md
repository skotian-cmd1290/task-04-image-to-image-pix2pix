# Image-to-Image Translation using cGAN (pix2pix)

A simple image-to-image translation web application inspired by the pix2pix conditional GAN architecture.

This project demonstrates how an input image can be transformed into a new output image using learned image mappings, presented through a clean Streamlit web interface.

## Features
- Upload an input image
- Apply pix2pix-style image transformation
- Interactive Streamlit UI
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly implementation

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- PIL (Pillow)
- NumPy
- PyTorch (conceptual pix2pix style)

## Use Case
Built as **Task-04 for Prodigy Infotech Internship**, showcasing understanding of image-to-image translation and generative models.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
